<!-- Implementing Promises in ES6 -->
 <!-- Promises are used to handle asynchronous(ex  API calls, file reading) operations in JavaScript. -->
  <!-- API Call Example step by step from a perspective of restaurant -->
   <!-- Step 1: You order something to eat Waiter takes your order -->
   <!-- Step 2: Kitchen prepares your food (this takes time) -->
   <!-- Step 3: Once food is ready, waiter brings it to your table -->
<!-- here Asynchronous behavior is simulated using Promises -->
 <!-- English meaning of Asynchronous: Not occurring at the same time ex in  a e commerce website  following things are asynchronous: -->
<!-- 1. Loading products -->
<!-- 2. Fetching user data -->
<!-- 3. Processing payments -->
 <!-- hence we need timers to simulate delays -->
 <!-- below things are synchronous:  Means they happen in a sequence -->
<!-- 1. Rendering UI components -->
<!-- 2. Handling user input -->
<!-- 3. Updating the DOM -->

<!-- i want to fetch data from an API with promises -->
 <!-- Step 1: Create a function to fetch data from the API -->
  <!-- Step 2:  calling fetch data-->

    <!-- <script>
        function fetchData() {
            return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                let success = true; // Simulating success or failure
                if (!success) {
                    reject("Error: Unable to fetch data from API.");
                    return;
                }
                console.log("Fetching data from API...");
                setTimeout(() => {
                    const data = { id: 1, name: "John Doe" }; // Simulated API response
                    resolve(data);
                }, 1500); // 1.5 seconds delay
            });
        }

        // Calling fetchData function
        fetchData()
            .then((data) => {
                console.log("Data received from API:", data);
            });
    </script> -->

<!--  i want to call below API using promise for handling data asynchronously -->
  <!-- fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(json => console.log(json)) -->
 <!-- fetch and promise are used together to handle asynchronous operations in a more manageable way -->
  <!-- fetch indirectly returns a promise that resolves to the Response object representing the response to the request -->
<!-- fetch is defined in ES6 as well as in modern browsers supporting typescript  -->

    <script>
        function fetchTodo() {
            return fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos')
            // fetch() returns a promise that resolves to the Response object representing the response to the request
                .then(response => {
                    if (!response.ok) {
                        throw new Error('Network response was not ok ' + response.statusText);
                    }
                    return response.json();
                });
        }

        // Calling fetchTodo function
        fetchTodo()
            .then(data => {
                console.log("Todo item fetched from API:", data);
            })
            .catch(error => {
                console.error("There was a problem with the fetch operation:", error);
            });
    </script>


<!-- In above demo Promise is used to handle asynchronous API calls so that we can manage the flow of data more effectively. -->

<!-- Here we are using promises to handle asynchronous operations so that we can write cleaner and more manageable code. -->
<!-- if we dont use promises, we would have to use callbacks, leading to "callback hell" ie  pyramid of doom -->
 <!-- Advantage of promise is that it allows us to chain multiple asynchronous operations together, making the code more readable and easier to maintain. -->
